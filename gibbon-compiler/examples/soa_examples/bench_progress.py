"""A pinned, understated progress display for long benchmark campaigns.

Two lines are reserved at the bottom of the terminal and never move: a
context line naming what is happening right now, and a hairline rule
carrying overall completion and a time estimate.  Everything the driver
prints scrolls above them.

WHY A SCROLL REGION rather than repainting in place: a campaign prints as
it goes, and a bar that is merely redrawn at the cursor gets pushed up the
screen by that output, so the thing you are watching keeps moving.  A DEC
scroll region (`CSI top;bottom r`) confines scrolling to the lines above
the reserved rows, which is what keeps the bar still.

The hazard of that approach is leaving the terminal with a restricted
scroll region if the process dies -- the shell prompt would then be stuck
in a window a few lines short.  'close()' is therefore idempotent and is
wired to both `atexit` and the fatal signals, so the region is released
however the run ends.

Disabled automatically when stdout is not a TTY, so redirecting to a log
writes no escape sequences.

# NOTE: the dim attribute (CSI 2m) is deliberately NOT used anywhere.
#
# It was used for the context line and the empty track, on the theory that
# they should recede. On a terminal whose theme renders dim as mid-grey, that
# made both unreadable against the background -- and "recessive" is worthless
# if it is invisible. Everything except the filled bar now uses the
# terminal's own foreground colour, which contrasts with its background by
# definition. The track still reads as lighter than the bar because the GLYPH
# differs (light shade vs full block), not because of an attribute.

# Whole cells only. Eighth-width partial blocks (U+258F..U+2589) were used
# for a smoother leading edge, but they are LEFT-aligned within their cell:
# the unfilled remainder of that cell shows the raw terminal background, which
# against the textured light-shade track reads as a transparent notch between
# the bar and the track. The two glyph families do not compose. Sub-cell
# smoothness is not worth a visual artifact on a bar that advances over hours;
# a whole cell on a 60-cell bar is 1.7%.

    bar. Colour 40 is a saturated mid green with usable contrast against both
    light and dark terminal backgrounds -- unlike bright green (92 / colour

    Bold is applied as well, because several terminal themes render the
