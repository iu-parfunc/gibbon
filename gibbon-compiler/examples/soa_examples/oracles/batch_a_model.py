"""Independent Python oracle for Batch A: List.hs, LinearListReduction.hs,
reduceNestedList.hs, TernaryTree.hs, and MonoTree.hs. Every program
modeled here uses Int64 consistently for its semantic integer data.

Nothing here reads Gibbon output.  Each function recomputes the program's
result directly from its OWN source definition (closed-form where the
recursion telescopes into simple arithmetic), at the exact size baked into
that program's `gibbon_main`.

`wrap64` (two's-complement Int64 wraparound) is still applied at the
closed-form summation boundary in every model that has one, keeping this
model's operation-by-operation Int64 wrapping discipline as the
reference value regardless of whether a given program's true total turns
out to need it. For every program modeled here, the true (unwrapped)
bignum total is comfortably inside Int64's +-9.223e18 range (List's
~5.0e15, LinearListReduction's ~5.0e13, reduceNestedList's ~5.0e11,
MonoTree's ~2.3e9), so `wrap64` is an identity on all of them at the
committed sizes.
