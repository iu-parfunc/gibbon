Gibbon Compiler Benchmark Suite v3.1
=====================================
Benchmarks AoS vs SoA gibbon programs and produces publication-quality
LaTeX tables and matplotlib figures.

Field-usage analysis:
  Gibbon's SoA mode is hypothesised to win on passes that access fewer
  fields of the ADT (more "dead" fields skipped, fewer cache streams).
  Two source annotations drive the analysis:

    (a) ADT field count — one comment per source file, near the type def:
          -- @BENCH adt_fields=5

    (b) Per-pass field usage — extend the existing printsym line:
          _ = printsym (quote "Running pass SumArea (fold, uses=2): ")

  From these the script computes:
    dead_fields = adt_fields - uses
    dead_ratio  = dead_fields / adt_fields   (0 = all used, 1 = none used)

Buffer analysis (automatic — no extra annotation needed):
  The script parses each Haskell source file to find the main ADT definition
  and counts memory buffers under each memory layout:

    AoS: always 1 buffer (all data packed together).

    SoA: 1 buffer for constructor tags
         + 1 buffer per scalar field
         + 0 buffers for self-recursive fields
         + 1 buffer for non-self packed fields annotated Linear
         + recursively counted buffers for non-self packed fields annotated Factored

       e.g.  data Tree = Node Int Tree Tree | Leaf Int
             with Tree annotated Linear
             → tags:1  Node.Int:1  Leaf.Int:1
             → soa_total_buffers = 3
             (self-recursive Tree fields add no extra buffers)

       e.g.  data ListA = ConsA Int ListA | NilA
             data List  = Cons Int ListA List | Nil
             with ListA annotated Linear, List annotated Factored
             → tags:1  Cons.Int:1  Cons.ListA:1
             → soa_total_buffers = 3
             (the self-recursive List field adds no new buffer)

  Per-pass buffer access:
    dead_fields = adt_fields - uses         (adt_fields and uses both include recursive)
    dead_ratio  = dead_fields / adt_fields

    soa_total_buffers is known from the parsed ADT definition and SoA layout
    annotations and shown in the summary table. Per-pass SoA buffer usage is
    NOT computed: uses= counts total fields (recursive + non-recursive) and
    the field-layout split within a pass is not available without further
    annotation.

  Optional annotation to name the target ADT explicitly (overrides heuristic):
    -- @BENCH adt_type=MyTypeName

Fold/map detection (dual strategy):
  PRIMARY:  exe output line "Running pass Foo (fold, uses=2):"
  FALLBACK: source-file printsym scan (also captures uses= and adt_fields)

Usage:
  ./gibbon_benchmark.py                              run all programs
  ./gibbon_benchmark.py --programs DomTree.hs        run one program
  ./gibbon_benchmark.py --clean                      force recompile
  ./gibbon_benchmark.py --generate-paper             LaTeX + figures
  ./gibbon_benchmark.py --iterations 50 --generate-paper
  ./gibbon_benchmark.py --iterations 1               match cold manual run
  ./gibbon_benchmark.py --dump-raw                   save raw exe output

    --programs picks the candidate set (default: DEFAULT_PROGRAMS);
    --exclude-programs then subtracts from whatever that set is, which is
    what lets a full evaluation skip a benchmark that is broken, too slow,
    or otherwise not wanted for this campaign without having to retype the
    other 21 names. Both accept the loose spellings normalize_program_name
    handles.

    Each exclusion is a shell-style glob matched case-insensitively against
    the whole candidate name (fnmatch: `*`, `?`, `[...]`), so a family comes
    out in one entry rather than name by name. Note that the octree family
    is spelled two ways -- OctTree_*.hs is Oct+Tree, ColorOctree.hs is
    Color+Octree -- so `OctTree*` leaves ColorOctree.hs behind; all nine
    take either two patterns (`OctTree* ColorOctree.hs`) or one that spans
    both spellings (`*oct*ree*`). Matching is anchored to the full name, not
    a substring search, which is what keeps a literal `List.hs` from also
    taking LinearListReduction.hs and reduceNestedList.hs; a literal name
    has no wildcards and so still matches only itself.

    An exclusion that matches NOTHING in the candidate set is an ERROR, not
    a silent no-op: a typo (or a pattern the shell already expanded) would
    otherwise leave the unwanted benchmark in a multi-hour run, and the
    mistake would only surface in the results. Excluding everything is
    likewise an error rather than a no-op run.

    A --programs entry naming a program with NO source file is likewise an
    error, when `programs_dir` is supplied so existence can be checked. It was
    not, and that cost a real multi-hour run: `--programs Add1Tree8.hs` (the
    actual name is Add1TreeInt8.hs) was accepted, every configuration failed
    "source not found", and the run produced a report of nothing but failures
    and a PDF with no per-program tables at all -- the mistake only visible
    after the fact. An unmatched --exclude-programs pattern was already an
    error for exactly this reason; a misspelled --programs entry is the same

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# C compiler selection
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pinned deliberately.  GCC 15 fails to register-promote the SoA traversal's
# cursors across loop iterations, which made SoA folds run at IPC ~1.5 against
# AoS's ~4 and cost a spurious 2.7x on List.hs/sumList.  A silent toolchain
# upgrade can change SoA results by multiples, so the compiler is chosen
# explicitly and its version is recorded in every report rather than being
# whatever `gcc` happens to resolve to.
#
# A prior version of this comment additionally claimed that GCC 16 promotes
# those cursors well enough that "SoA comes out slightly FASTER than AoS".
# That claim was measured before List.hs's fields were migrated to explicit
# per-field GibInt32 codegen (under the old whole-program `--int32` macro
# trick, where the RTS's own GibInt was also 32-bit). Under the current
# explicit-width codegen it does not hold: with GCC 16.2.0, --no-ran,
# --use-mutable-cursors, List.hs's SoA sumList/sumListAcc measures SLOWER
# than AoS, by roughly 3.8x, not faster.
#
# Root cause (isolated by recompiling the current generated List.soa.c with
# ONLY the sumList/sumListAcc accumulator/return type widened from GibInt32 to
# GibInt (int64), everything else byte-identical): GCC 16's -O3 -flto inliner
# produces a materially worse loop for this specific shape -- a self-recursive
# tail-position function taking Gibbon's SoA `GibCursor x[2]` array-by-
# reference parameters (aliased/restrict-qualified sub-cursors threaded
# through the whole recursive chain) -- when the accumulator is 32-bit than
# when it is 64-bit; widening it alone restores AoS-competitive timing with no
# other change. Simplified reproducers (a plain malloc'd linked-list fold, and
# the same fold using the real branchy gib_add_i32/gib_u2s_i32 deterministic-
# wraparound helper) do NOT reproduce the gap, so this is specific to the
# interaction between GCC 16's LTO loop/tail-call heuristics and Gibbon's
# cursor-array calling convention at narrow width -- a GCC 16 code-generation-
# quality characteristic of that combination, not a Gibbon compiler defect,
# and not something to "fix" by widening List.hs's types (List.hs's Int32
# policy stays as-is; RAN performance/bugs are separately deferred).

    Pure: no filesystem access, no subprocess, no compiler lookup.  `cc` is
    passed in rather than resolved here so tests can construct and assert on a
    command without a compiler installed.

    NOTE ON WIDTH: this function takes no width parameter, and must not grow
    one.  Integer width is declared by the source program (`Int8`/`Int16`/
    `Int32`/`Int64`; bare `Int` means `Int64`), and a mixed-width program has no
    single width a benchmark flag could select.  The removed `--int32`
    whole-program mode used to be appended here.

    `--sse4.1` and `--no-gcc-vectorize` are deliberately independent of
    `--opt-vectorization`: the first grants an ISA permission to the C
    compiler, the second suppresses the C compiler's own auto-vectorizer, and
    only the third turns on Gibbon's SIMD pass.

    `simd_isa` is ALWAYS passed explicitly, to EVERY configuration, and this is
    load-bearing for the comparison rather than a convenience.  Gibbon defaults
    `--simd-isa` to avx2 when `--opt-vectorization` is given and to sse2
    otherwise, so leaving it implicit compiles the Gibbon-vectorized column for
    a 256-bit target while every column it is compared against gets the x86-64
    baseline -- where the C compiler's own auto-vectorizer can only reach SSE2.
    Measured: the same non-vectorized program contains 0 `ymm` references
    without the flag and 528 with it.  That difference lands entirely in
    Gibbon's favour, so the flag is pinned for all configurations.

    `c_arith_mode` is ALWAYS passed explicitly as `--c-arithmetic=<mode>` --
    never omitted to fall back on Gibbon's own compiler default (`portable`).
    The driver's own default is `unsafe`; see `DEFAULT_C_ARITH_MODE`. This
    never adds `-fwrapv` or any other C flag itself -- that is Gibbon's job
    for `wrapv` mode.

    `auto_loopification=False` suppresses `--auto-loopification` while still
    passing `--opt-loopification` when `enable_loopification` is set -- for a
    caller that knows every relevant function is already annotated
    `OPT:MayVectorize`, so structural inference isn't needed. Defaults to
    True, preserving every existing caller's paired behavior unchanged.

# run can call it and get real `BenchmarkResult` objects with real pass

# compile/run/qualify path (`compile_one`/`run_exe`/`qualify_variant`, the
# same functions every other row in this file goes through) so no numeric
# value it produces bypasses the verified-result contract. It is NOT invoked
# by this file's own test suite; only the RENDERING function
# (`_table_add1tree_widths`) is exercised here, against synthetic

# The high-arithmetic-intensity width/vectorization table.
#
# Same scope note as ADD1TREE_WIDTH_* above: this table performs no timing
# on its own. `collect_arithintensity_width_results` is real compile/run/
# qualify plumbing for a future timed run; only the rendering function
# (`_table_arith_intensity`) is exercised by this file's own tests, against
# synthetic fixtures -- see test_arithintensity_widths.py's
# `TestArithIntensityWidthTable`.
#
# W64 SIMD EXCLUSION (the one structural difference from Add1Tree's table):
# `L3.simdCapable VecOpMul (IntS W64)` is `True` in the current compiler --
# the only packed W64 multiply helper that exists (`gib_vec_mul_int64x2`)
# spills each 128-bit register to a 2-element scalar array, calls the same
# scalar `gib_mul_i64` used on the non-vectorized path per lane, and
# reassembles the register (Codegen.hs's own comment: "NOT an
# acceleration... retained ONLY because W64 vectorization already shipped
# with them"). Enabling --opt-vectorization for a W64 MayVectorize
# multiply is therefore CORRECT but not real SIMD, and this benchmark's
# policy is that it must never be reported as one. Rather than change the
# global capability matrix (`L3.simdCapable`) to work around a codegen
# quirk unrelated to compiler correctness, ARITHINTENSITY_WIDTH_CONFIGS
# simply never builds a "soa_simd" config for width 64
# (collect_arithintensity_width_results skips it structurally, not via a
# runtime check on the result), and _table_arith_intensity hardcodes width
# 64's SIMD/speedup cells to a fixed N/A reason BEFORE consulting any
# BenchmarkResult -- so a stray or synthetic W64 "soa_simd" result, however
# constructed, can never reach that cell as a number. This is proven, not
# assumed: see TestArithIntensityWidthTable.

# measuring bytes moved rather than vectorization. It is now 4.75

# W64 is deliberately absent from "soa_simd" -- see the module-level note
# above. Only W8/16/32 get a real Gibbon-SIMD config.
# EVERY column here disables the C compiler's own auto-vectorizer.
#
# It was previously disabled only on the Gibbon-side columns (soa_loopify,
# soa_simd) while the two raw columns kept it, which made loopification look
# like a REGRESSION: measured on Int16, the table reported raw 0.1875s against
# loopified 0.4663s -- 2.5x slower -- because the raw column was being
# vectorized by GCC and the loopified one was not. Compared honestly,
# loopification wins either way: 0.1875 -> 0.1374 with the C vectorizer on for
# both (1.36x), and 0.5184 -> 0.4651 with it off for both (1.11x).
#
# GCC helps the recursive form more than one might expect because the kernel
# is straight-line arithmetic over independent chains, which its SLP
# (basic-block) vectorizer packs even though the traversal itself is
# recursive; --no-gcc-vectorize disables SLP as well as loop vectorization.
#
# These programs exist to isolate GIBBON's SIMD pass, so the C vectorizer is
# off in every column and the table measures one thing. The absolute times are
# therefore NOT what a normal build produces -- the per-program PLDI tables
# carry the C-vectorizer-enabled configurations for that.

# Per-pass DELTA tables: what each optimization actually bought, in seconds.
#
# Every entry is (layout, symbol, baseline config, feature config, legend
# text). Each symbol's subscript names the feature using the SAME letters
# the configuration symbols use (PLDI_COL_SYMBOLS): m mutable cursors,
# \ell loopified, b selective buffer sharing, v Gibbon SIMD vectorization,
# av the C auto-vectorizer (spelled `+av` as a superscript there), t the C
# tail-call optimization (`\neg t` there). A reader who has learned the
# configuration legend can therefore read a delta column without relearning
# anything. The value rendered is (BASELINE - FEATURE) / FEATURE as a
# percentage -- identically (speedup - 1) x 100 -- so a POSITIVE number
# always means "enabling this made the pass faster", in every column of
# every table. The denominator is the FEATURE, not the baseline: against
# the baseline the scale saturates (a 5x win reads 80%, an 8x win 87.5%),
# which compresses exactly the large improvements these tables exist to
# size. See `_signed_percent` for the full argument. Either way the numbers
# are scale-free and so comparable across passes whose absolute times
# differ by orders of magnitude.
#
# That uniform orientation is a deliberate normalization of the request,
# which spelled three of the twelve columns feature-first (mutable cursors,
# selective buffer sharing, and Gibbon-vec-on-top-of-auto-vec) and asked for
# absolute values |x - y|. Magnitudes are exactly as requested; what changes
# is that the sign survives -- and it has to, because two of the columns ask
# whether one vectorizer HINDERS or HELPS the other, which an absolute value
# cannot express.
