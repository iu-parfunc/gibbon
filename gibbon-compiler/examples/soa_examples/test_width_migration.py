"""Adversarial width-migration regression checks for the curated
DEFAULT_PROGRAMS benchmarks (BW-03).

Parses each curated DEFAULT_PROGRAMS source's `data T = C1 f1 f2 ... | C2
...` declaration into an explicit, enumerated list of (constructor, field
index, type) triples -- not a naive whole-file regex -- and checks it
against a hand-maintained width manifest for that program. This is meant
to fail loudly on exactly these regression classes: a bare `Int` field
reappearing in a curated ADT, KDTree's fields drifting off Int64, an
AoS/SoA field-width disagreement, and an oracle for a VW-24-blocked
program silently being "fixed" to match the known-wrong compiled output
instead of staying an honest, independently derived value.

This does not invoke Gibbon or gcc: it is a fast, static, repeatable check
over the source text and oracles/manifest.json, meant to run in CI/unit-test
time, not benchmark time.
