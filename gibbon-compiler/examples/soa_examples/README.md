## Integer width is a source property

There is no whole-program width mode.  `--int32`/`--gibbon-int32`/`--32-bit`
were removed from the compiler and from these drivers; the old spellings are
recognized only to reject them with an actionable message.

Width is declared by the source program: `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `Int64`, and
bare `Int`, which means `Int64`.  A program may mix widths in one datatype, in
which case it has no single width at all.  To compare widths, write explicit
width variants as separate source programs.

`programs/{AOS,SOA}/MixedWidthSmoke.hs` is the paired explicit-width driver
smoke fixture (Int8 + Int16 + Int32 + Int64 in one constructor).

## SSE2 and SSE4.1

* Gibbon's explicit SIMD baseline is **SSE2**.
* `--sse4.1` adds `-msse4.1` to the generated C translation unit.  It is an ISA
  permission for the C compiler, independent of `--opt-vectorization`
  (Gibbon's own SIMD pass) and of `--no-gcc-vectorize`.
* W32 multiplication is emitted by Gibbon as a verified SSE2 `_mm_mul_epu32`
  plus shuffle/interleave sequence.  A C compiler *may* recognize and replace
  that sequence under SSE4.1, but Gibbon does not select `_mm_mullo_epi32`.
* W64 equality does have an explicit `#ifdef __SSE4_1__` branch using
  `_mm_cmpeq_epi64`.
* W64 ordered comparisons need SSE4.2 (`_mm_cmpgt_epi64`) or an emulation, and
  remain scalar.
* General packed integer division/modulus does not exist in SSE4 and remains
  scalar.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1 – install Python deps (once)
pip install matplotlib numpy

# 2 – run all programs, generate paper materials
./gibbon_benchmark.py --generate-paper

# 3 – single program, lots of iterations
./gibbon_benchmark.py --programs DomTree.hs --iterations 50 --generate-paper

# 4 – force recompile everything then generate paper
./gibbon_benchmark.py --clean --generate-paper
```

## Arithmetic-Intensity Programs — run the acceptance check

`programs/{SOA,AoS}/MapIntensityV2.hs` sweeps arithmetic intensity while holding
memory traffic fixed. It only measures intensity if the arithmetic it declares
actually survives into the generated code, and **it repeatedly has not**:

- constant multipliers were strength-reduced to shift+add (zero multiplies emitted);
- `sum_k (i + c_k) * m` was reassociated to `m * (N*i + sum c_k)` — one multiply
  at every N;
- seeding extra chains from affine offsets of `i` collapsed again under CSE.

Every one of these collapses is **silent**. The benchmark still runs, still
produces a table, and the table means nothing. Before citing any intensity
number, run:

```bash
./check_intensity_codegen.py                 # SoA (width read from the source)
./check_intensity_codegen.py --layout AOS
./check_intensity_codegen.py --int64
```

It builds scalar and `--sse4.1` configurations, disassembles each map function's
innermost multiply-carrying loop, and asserts the multiply counts declared in
`EXPECTED_MULTIPLIES` — plus no `pslld` (strength reduction), no scalarized
`imul` inside a vector loop, and a 16-byte pointer stride (real cross-element
SIMD rather than SLP within a single element). Or fold it into a benchmark run:

```bash
./benchmark_layout_versions.py --verify-intensity-codegen ...   # verify only
./benchmark_layout_versions.py --intensity-report ...            # verify + detailed report
```

The three families in that program are **not** interchangeable:

| Family | Multiplies/element | ILP | What it measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mapSer<N>` | N | 1 | latency ceiling — one serial Horner chain |
| `mapChain<D>` | 2D+2 | 2 | effect of added ILP at matched intensity |
| `mapPar<N>` | **1, at every N** | — | reassociation **control**, not an intensity point |

`mapPar` is retained deliberately, and the checker asserts its collapse. Do not
cite it as evidence about arithmetic intensity.

## Fold / Map Classification

The script automatically detects whether each pass is a **fold** or **map**
by reading the print statements already in your source code.

**Required format** (already in your programs):

```haskell
_ = printsym (quote "Running pass SumArea (fold): ")
_ = printsym (quote "Running pass scaleLayout (map): ")
_ = printsym (quote "Running pass nearestDist (fold like): ")
```

The keyword inside parentheses can be:
- `fold`, `fold like`, `fold-like` → classified as **fold**
- `map`, `map like`, `map-like` → classified as **map**

When you run the script you will see:

```
======================================================================
Detecting fold/map classification from source print statements ...
======================================================================
  ✓ DomTree.hs: 'SumArea' → fold  (keys e.g. ['SumArea', 'sumarea', 'SumAreaPass'])
  ✓ DomTree.hs: 'scaleLayout' → map
  ⚠  OtherProg.hs: no fold/map annotations found
======================================================================
```

If a pass cannot be matched it shows `?` in the table — check that your
print-statement name matches the pass key printed in benchmark output.

### Folds and maps are reported separately

`benchmark_layout_versions.py` emits each program's passes in **separate map and
fold sections**, because they are not comparable: only map passes are eligible
for loopification, selective buffer sharing and SIMD vectorization, so only they
carry the vectorizer columns. A program with only folds gets only a fold section.

### Two report modes

By default the sweep runs and reports **one** vectorized configuration —
`loop+share both vec (SSE4.1)`: both vectorizers on, `-msse4.1`, i.e. every
vectorization capability enabled. Splitting that into the full 2x2 (GCC's
auto-vectorizer and Gibbon's SIMD pass varied independently) plus the SSE4.1
axis exists to *attribute* a speedup between them, which is the point of the
arithmetic-intensity experiment and noise on application traversals — measured
over the suite's 17 map passes, the six configurations differ by ~9% end to end
and mostly reflect code layout. Five configurations are therefore neither built
nor reported.

`--intensity-report` switches to **arithmetic-intensity mode** (and implies
`--verify-intensity-codegen`): the full
vectorizer matrix, plus a per-map **vectorization vs loop+share scalar** table —
`(pass, mul/el, ILP, scalar, SSE4.1, speedup)`. Read *that* table for what
vectorization bought you, not the AoS-baseline tables: those divide by AoS
recursive, whose cost also grows with arithmetic intensity, so their ratio
*shrinks* as intensity rises even while vectorization is helping more.

`ILP` comes from an optional `ilp=N` pass annotation (see `ANNOTATIONS.md`);
`mul/el` is measured from the generated assembly, not declared.

Fold sections carry **only the layout and traversal columns** (AoS/SoA x
immutable/mutable recursive). The loopification, buffer-sharing and vectorizer
columns are omitted because those flags fire exclusively on `OPT:MayVectorize`
passes -- a fold-only program compiles to byte-identical C in all of them
(verified by diffing the generated code), so any difference in those columns is
code layout and allocator state, not an optimization.

### Fold-only programs skip the map configurations

For the same reason, a program declaring no map pass is **not built or run** in
the loopification/sharing/vectorization configurations at all. Half the default
suite is fold-only (11 of 22), so this removes ~44% of the builds and runs from
a full sweep.

The three whole-program summary tables (Total Timed Pass Runtime, Speedup, Run
Status) are split the same way: a **Programs with map passes** table with all
columns, and a **Fold-only programs** table with just the four layout/traversal
columns. `missing` in Run Status means a configuration ran but produced no row —
worth investigating — since configurations that were deliberately skipped are no
longer shown as columns at all.

Pass `--no-skip-mapless` to run them anyway -- e.g. to measure the
representation cost that `--store-scalar-field-counts` imposes on folds, which
is a real effect (it adds scalar-count footers that fold traversals must step
over) and the one thing the skip hides.

---

## Smart Recompilation

The script compares the **modification timestamp** of each `.hs` source file
against its compiled `.exe`.  If the exe is newer than the source, compilation
is skipped.

- Recompilation runs **in parallel** (one thread per CPU core).
- **Execution always runs sequentially** to avoid benchmark interference.

Use `--clean` to force full recompilation regardless of timestamps.

## Generated LaTeX Tables

`performance_table.tex` contains:

| Table | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| Table 1 – Summary | End-to-end time split into Fold / Map columns, total AoS time, speedup |
| Tables 2 – N | One table per program: pass name, type (F/M/?), AoS (s), SoA (s), speedup |

Times use **scientific notation** (`3.27e-03`) so nothing rounds to `0.00`.

Bold highlights the faster variant when the difference exceeds 10%.

Each per-program table ends with **Total** and **Geomean** rows.

**Include in your paper:**

```latex
\usepackage{booktabs}   % preamble

\input{performance_table.tex}

% reference as \ref{tab:summary}, \ref{tab:DomTree}, ...
```

## Generated Figures

### `speedup_comparison.pdf`
Horizontal bar chart with two bars per program:
- **Blue** — speedup across fold passes
- **Orange** — speedup across map passes

Dashed reference line at 1.0×.

### `per_program/<Program>.pdf`  ← main result figure
One figure per program showing **every pass** side-by-side:
- **Error bars** = standard deviation across iterations
- **Geomean bar** at the right (dark blue AoS / purple SoA), value labelled
- Width scales automatically with number of passes

### `heatmaps/<Program>_heatmap.pdf`
Single-row heatmap for that program showing only the passes it actually
has (no 1× noise from absent passes).  Red = SoA slower, green = SoA faster.

### `pass_breakdown_all.pdf`
All programs stacked.  Each pass uses a distinct **colour + hatch pattern**
for accessibility.  Horizontal legend below the plots.
