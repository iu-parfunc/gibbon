-- | Conservative loopification for `OPT:MayVectorize` traversals over
-- fully-factored SoA layouts.  A structural nano-pass: recursion is removed
-- only when a simple buffer-local plan can be extracted from the cursorized L3
-- body.  Any unmet invariant leaves the function unchanged.
--
-- Activation:
--
-- * Requires `--opt-loopification` plus `--store-scalar-field-counts`; SoA loop
--   bounds come from scalar-count footers, so the former without the latter is
--   a hard error whenever an SoA candidate exists.  (Pure AoS has nothing here
--   to loopify; see `Gibbon.Passes.LoopifyFlatTraversals`.)
-- * The function must carry `OPT:MayVectorize`, or `--auto-loopification` must
--   be set.  Automatic mode skips compiler-generated helpers (`_copy_*`,
--   `_print_*`, `_traverse_*`, `_unpack_*`).
-- * The annotation is a promise that recursive calls are independent, but a
--   syntactic check still rejects loopification when a value derived from a
--   self-call feeds a parent scalar write, tag write, scrutinee or conditional.
-- * The cursor ABI is inferred from arguments: four cursor arrays of the SoA
--   length (input ends, output ends, output cursors, input cursors).  Extra
--   arguments are loop-invariant scalars.  Buffer 0 is the tag stream; scalar
--   buffers follow constructor fields in `DDef` order, skipping packed fields.
--
-- Scalar plans:
--
-- * Each branch writes each scalar buffer at most once, to the buffer for that
--   constructor and field, with a matching scalar type.
-- * Update expressions must be pure and mention only scalar reads from the same
--   constructor instance or loop-invariant arguments; cross-constructor scalar
--   dependencies are rejected.
-- * Unmentioned buffers are identity-copied, leaving selective buffer sharing
--   to decide which can be shared.
-- * A scalar conditional is accepted only when both branches write the same
--   buffer set; it lowers to unit-valued control flow, since `ForE` and
--   `WhileCursor` bodies are unit tails.
--
-- Chunks and footers:
--
-- * Emits one outer chunk loop and one inner counted `ForE` per buffer.  The
--   first chunk count comes from the end-of-region footer, later counts from
--   the footer at the preceding redirection boundary, matching the RTS cyclic
--   encoding.  `LoopifiedTraversalFusion` may fuse the remainder afterwards.
-- * Tags are copied verbatim from input to output, so `extractBranchPlans`
--   refuses any branch writing a tag other than its own.  Every branch body is
--   scanned against a whitelist (`scanBranchBody`); anything the plan cannot
--   reproduce -- another call, an indirection or tagged-cursor write, a packed
--   `MemCpy`, an arena/region operation -- bails out to the recursive body
--   rather than dropping the effect.
-- * An untouched footer reads back as 0, indistinguishable from an empty chunk,
--   so consuming absent counts would silently yield empty output.
--   `countGuaranteedTyCons` therefore refuses to loopify over a type unless
--   every user-written producer of it establishes counts.
-- * A scalar update depending on another buffer gets its own cursor anchored at
--   the original input array, advanced in lock-step across redirection
--   boundaries.  It must not reuse that buffer's main cursor, which its own
--   loop may already have consumed.
-- * A loopified map is itself a builder, so it writes scalar-count metadata for
--   every output buffer including the tag stream.  Shape is preserved, so
--   output chunk counts equal input counts and the footer is set once per chunk
--   rather than bumped per element.
--
-- Limitations: scalar loops only (SIMD is `VectorizeTraversals`); the accepted
-- scalar language is variables, literals, projections, primitive scalar
-- operations, and the conditional above.

-- | Encode a data-constructor name so it can be carried inside a generated
-- loop variable's name and recovered later.
--
-- Note [The loop-name constructor key must be injective]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- 'Gibbon.Passes.LoopifiedTraversalFusion' fuses adjacent chunk loops that
-- agree on the constructor key it parses back out of this name, and the fused
-- loop drives EVERY participating buffer from ONE representative buffer's
-- per-chunk trip count.  That is sound only because two scalar buffers of the
-- same constructor necessarily hold the same number of logical elements in the
-- same physical chunk (one element per occurrence of that constructor, and
-- 'BoundsCheckVector' grows every peer buffer together, so chunk boundaries
-- stay aligned).  It is NOT sound across constructors, whose per-chunk counts
-- are unrelated.
--
-- So this encoding carries a correctness obligation: distinct constructors must
-- get distinct keys.  It previously collapsed every non-alphanumeric character
-- to @'_'@, which is not injective -- @A'@ and @A_@ both became @A_@.  Their
-- two buffers are adjacent (buffer indices are assigned in constructor order,
-- then field order), so the fusion pass merged them and ran the @A_@ loop for
-- the number of @A'@ elements.  Measured on a 40-node list with a 1:3
-- frequency skew: @--opt-loop-fusion@ turned the correct @60810@ into
-- @20403@, silently, in loopify, selective and vectorize alike.  Renaming the
-- constructors to @Ap@/@Aq@ -- same shape, same frequencies -- fused nothing
-- and gave the right answer.
--
-- The encoding below is injective: alphanumerics pass through, @'_'@ doubles,
-- and any other character @c@ becomes @'_' : show (ord c) ++ "_"@.  A decoder
-- can always tell the three cases apart by the character following a @'_'@
-- (@'_'@ itself, or a digit).  The output stays a legal C identifier tail, and
-- purely alphanumeric constructor names -- which is every constructor in the
-- example tree -- encode to themselves, so no existing loop name changes.

    --     }
    --
    -- So the trip count comes from the INPUT and the capacity from the OUTPUT,
    -- and nothing tests one against the other.  The invariant that makes this
    -- safe, and which anything editing this code must preserve:
    --
    --   For every output buffer b and every chunk:
    --       bytes_written(b) = chunk_count * width(b)  <=  usable_capacity(b)
    --
    --   because (i) `chunk_count` is recorded by the PRODUCER at the point the
    --   *widest* buffer of the group would overflow its chunk, so every
    --   narrower buffer carries slack; and (ii) the output region mirrors the
    --   input's chunk-size sequence -- same initial size from
    --   `gib_get_inf_init_chunk_size()`, same doubling in `gib_grow_region`,
    --   exactly one growth per input chunk transition.
    --
    -- Measured on a mixed-width Factored SoA
    -- @Node Int8 Int16 Int32 Int64 Rec@ at 3000 nodes, crossing four chunk
    -- boundaries: bytes per element are exactly 1.000 / 2.000 / 4.000 / 8.000,
    -- and the minimum margin per buffer is 863 / 742 / 500 / **16** bytes.  The
    -- W64 buffer is the binding constraint at a constant 16-byte margin; the
    -- others are slack.  Zero overruns, zero ASan findings, across W8/W16/W32/
    -- W64, counts 0..2049 spanning lane-1/lane/lane+1 for 16/8/4/2 lanes and
    -- chunk boundaries, in gibbon2/loopify/selective/vectorize.
    --
    -- The vector/tail split adds no risk: 'VectorizeTraversals' derives
    -- @simd_vec_count = chunk_count / lanes@ and
    -- @simd_tail_count = chunk_count % lanes@, so
    -- @lanes * vec_count + tail_count == chunk_count@ identically.
    --
    -- THREE UNCHECKED PRECONDITIONS.  These are residual risk; each
    -- would break the inequality above and none is verified at runtime:
    --   P1  the output cursor enters each chunk at its start.  A caller that
    --       has already written into the output chunk leaves less room while
    --       `chunk_count` still describes a full input chunk.
    --   P2  the output region's chunk sizes are pointwise >= the input's.
    --   P3  the input footer's `chunk_count` faithfully describes that chunk.
    -- 'tests/LoopifyTraversals.hs' pins the structure emitted here so the
    -- replacement mechanism cannot be dropped silently; the runtime capacity
    -- accounting is re-measurable with
    -- 'gibbon-compiler/tests/vw07_output_capacity.sh'.
