/*
 * A note on GibInt and the RTS ABI
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * `GibInt` used to mean different things on either side of the RTS/generated-
 * code boundary: the code generator defined `GIBBON_INT32` into the
 * *generated* translation unit under `--int32`, which made `GibInt` mean
 * `int32_t` there, while the separately-built RTS translation unit (which
 * never defined `GIBBON_INT32`) kept `GibInt` as `int64_t`.  That split is
 * gone.
 *
 * `--int32` is now a FRONTEND default: a bare, unannotated source `Int`
 * desugars to a 32-bit program type (see `Gibbon.HaskellFrontend.desugarType`
 * and `Gibbon.L0.Typecheck.compatDefaultIntWidth`), and the compiler carries
 * that width through L0-L4 like any other explicit one (`GibInt32`, below).
 * `GibInt` itself no longer changes meaning: it is `int64_t`, unconditionally,
 * on every generated translation unit and in the RTS, matching every other
 * shared struct/prototype that already had to be pinned this way (like
 * `GibVector.lower` / `.upper`).  Generated code no longer defines
 * `GIBBON_INT32` (the code generator only ever emits `GibInt8`/`GibInt16`/
 * `GibInt32`/`GibInt64`/`GibInt` now, chosen from the program's own inferred
 * width -- see `Gibbon.Passes.Codegen.codegenTy`), but this header does not
 * key any type definition on that macro either, so an out-of-tree build that
 * still defines it changes nothing.

 * two's-complement value congruent to the input modulo 2^N.  Truncating, never
 * saturating, never an overflow report.
 *
 * Why these are functions rather than a plain `(GibInt8) x` cast: converting an
 * out-of-range integer to a signed C type is IMPLEMENTATION-DEFINED (C17
 * 6.3.1.3p3) -- a conforming implementation may raise a signal instead of
 * wrapping.  Conversion to an UNSIGNED type is fully defined modulo 2^N, so the
 * reduction is done there and the high half is mapped into the negative range
 * with ordinary in-range arithmetic before any signed conversion happens.
 *
 * Consequently these contain: no signed overflow, no negation of INT64_MIN, no
 * out-of-range signed conversion, no dependence on the host's `char` signedness
 * (they never use bare `char`), and no dependence on byte order (they never
 * reinterpret storage).  The operand is taken as `GibInt64`; generated code
 * widens the exact-width signed source to `GibInt64` first, which is always
 * value-preserving because every source width is narrower or equal.
 *
 * `static inline` in the header: no ABI surface, and both GCC and Clang fold
 * these to the same one or two instructions a bare cast would have produced. */

/* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Deterministic integer arithmetic
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` and `^` on a Gibbon Int8/Int16/Int32/Int64, defined
 * so that the answer is the same one the interpreters and the packed SIMD
 * helpers produce -- under GCC and Clang, at -O0, -O2 and -O3.
 *
 * The specification (identical to "Deterministic integer arithmetic" in
 * `Gibbon.Language.Syntax`): for width N, all of `+`, `-`, `*` and `^` are
 * two's-complement modular, i.e. the unique signed N-bit value congruent to
 * the mathematical result modulo 2^N.  `/` truncates toward zero and `%` takes
 * the sign of the dividend, both as C specifies -- except that the two cases C
 * leaves UNDEFINED are pinned here instead: `MIN / -1` is `MIN`, `MIN % -1` is
 * `0`, and a zero divisor is a deterministic diagnostic rather than a trap.
 *
 * Why these are functions and not the bare C operators, which is what codegen
 * used to emit:
 *
 *   - signed overflow in C is UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR (C17 6.5p5), not wraparound.
 *     `INT32_MAX + 1` is not "-2147483648"; it is a licence for the optimizer
 *     to assume the addition never happens.  The SIMD path, meanwhile, wraps
 *     for real, because that is what the hardware does.  So the scalar and
 *     vector paths of the SAME loop were not specified to agree, and at -O2/-O3
 *     they are free to disagree.
 *   - `INT_MIN / -1` and `INT_MIN % -1` are undefined (C17 6.5.5p6) and on
 *     x86-64 raise SIGFPE, not a wrong answer.
 *   - division by zero is undefined and also traps.
 *
 * How they avoid re-introducing what they are removing:
 *
 *   - every value is reduced in UNSIGNED arithmetic, which C defines as modulo
 *     2^N for every input (C17 6.2.5p9).  No signed operation is ever allowed
 *     to overflow.
 *   - the unsigned result is mapped back to the signed type by
 *     `gib_u2s_i{8,16,32,64}` below, using only in-range arithmetic.  There is
 *     NO out-of-range unsigned-to-signed cast anywhere: that conversion is
 *     IMPLEMENTATION-DEFINED (C17 6.3.1.3p3) and a conforming implementation
 *     may raise a signal instead of wrapping, which is exactly the class of
 *     "works here, breaks there" bug this helper avoids.
 *   - INTEGER PROMOTION is handled by widening to `uint64_t` before operating.
 *     `uint8_t` and `uint16_t` do NOT stay unsigned under the usual arithmetic
 *     conversions: they promote to signed `int` (C17 6.3.1.1p2), so a
 *     "safely unsigned" `(uint8_t)a * (uint8_t)b` is in fact a signed `int`
 *     multiply that can overflow and be undefined.  Widening first makes the
 *     operand type explicit and removes the hazard for all four widths;
 *     truncation back to N bits happens deliberately, at the end, in
 *     `gib_u2s_*`.
 *   - each is a `static inline` function, not a macro, so an argument with a
 *     side effect is evaluated exactly once.
